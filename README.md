# The cross-sectional profitability of anomaly trading in the FX market
*__Marcell Kujbus, Financial Mathematician/Empirical Finance Researcher__* <br>
My work is based on the precious work of Menkhoff et al(2012), Han et al(2013), and Marshall (2016). <br>
In this research I investigate the efficiency of anomaly trading in the FX market (using G10 currencies). The portfolios/factors are sorted by the Momentum, 
Carry and Volatility phenomena. I invest in the portfolios/assets dollar neutrally and compare the results. 
According to the results, MOM, CARRY do exist in the FX market. An explanation was given why it is possible. 
A  more sophisticated method was applied to factor trading: market timing MA trading with lag 10 was used in the long and short positions. 
The results are convincing. <br>
The main result of the work is reaching 11.27% per annum with double sorting technique.
