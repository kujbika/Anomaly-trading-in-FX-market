# The cross-sectional profitability of anomaly trading on the fx market
*__Marcell Kujbus, Financial Mathematician/Empirical Finance Researcher__* <br>
My work is based on the precious work of Menkhoff (2012), Han (2013), and Marshall (2016). <br>
In this research I investigate the rule of anomaly trading on the FX market (using Q10). The portfolios/factors are sorted by Momentum, 
Carry and Volatility phenomena. I invest in the portfolios/assets and compare the results. 
In sample, and out of the sample test have been made. I also show the Break-even Transaction Cost (BECT) for each portfolios.
According to the results, MOM, CARRY, and VOL anomalies are still in the market. An explanation was given why it is possible. 
A  more sophisticated method was applied to factor trading: market timing MA trading was used in the long and short positions. 
The results are convincing. <br>
